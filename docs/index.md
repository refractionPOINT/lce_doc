> Get up and running fast with the [Quickstart Guide](lcc_quick_start.md).

## Core Concepts
 
LimaCharlie provides cloud-based security infrastructure. Flexible primitives like Sensors, Rules, and Outputs enable security engineering and security operations teams to build out their security posture, practices, and tool chain on a common platform. 

Using infrastructure-as-code, all of this can be tested and repeated across organizations & environments.

For a wider view of what's possible in LimaCharlie, check out the [Features Overview](features.md).

Here are the core components of the platform:

### Sensors

Software that bridges a source of standard JSON events and the LimaCharlie cloud, often with the ability to take action. EDR-class sensors include [Windows](sensors/windows.md), [Mac](sensors/mac.md), and [Linux](sensors/linux.md). Sensors can also bring in sources such as syslog, AWS Cloud Trail, or 1Password.

* Get started with [Sensors](sensors.md)

### Detection & Response Rules

Detectors-as-code that match JSON events and trigger actions in response.

* Get started with [Detection & Response Rules](dr.md)

### Net Policies

Policies for providing fine-grained endpoint-to-endpoint networking via Net sensors.

* Get started with [Net Policies](lc-net.md)

### Outputs

Streams that point toward external destinations (like S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Slack).

* Get started with [Outputs](outputs.md)

### Add-ons

Extends the capabilities of an organization by connecting Services or Lookup lists.

* Get started with [Add-ons](user_addons.md)
