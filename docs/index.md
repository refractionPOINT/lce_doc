# LimaCharlie Documentation

Welcome to the LimaCharlie documentation!

LimaCharlie provides cloud-based security infrastructure. Flexible primitives like [Sensors](sensors.md) and [Rules](dr.md) working with standard [Events](events-overview.md) enable security engineering and security operations teams to build out their security posture, practices, and tool chain on a common platform.

Right now you're on the docs which is the best place to build a solid foundation using LimaCharlie.

## Core Concepts

For a wider view of what's possible in LimaCharlie, the [Features Overview](features.md) is a good place to start.

From an infrastructure point of view, here are the core components of the platform:

### [Sensors](sensors.md)

* A great place to start. Sensors are software that integrates with the host and collects standard JSON events to send to LimaCharlie.

### [Detection & Response Rules](dr.md)

* Detectors-as-code that match JSON events and trigger actions in response.

### [Net Policies](dr.md)

* Network access policies that provide fine-grained endpoint-to-endpoint networking.

### [Outputs](outputs.md)

* Streams that point toward external destinations (like S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Slack).

### [Add-ons](user_addons.md)

* Add-ons extend the capabilities of an organization by connecting Services or adding Lookups.
