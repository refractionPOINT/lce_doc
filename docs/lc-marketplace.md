# Add-ons Marketplace


LimaCharlie has a marketplace where users can extend an organization's capabilities by subscribing to add-ons.

These fall into one of several categories, each of which is linked below.

* API
* Lookup
* Services

## Developing Products

Users interested in creating their own products or services that can be integrated with LimaCharlie through the Add-On Marketplace should start [here](./user_addons.md).

## Monetizing Products with LimaCharlie 

LimaCharlie is partnering with developers on a case-by-case basis to enable them to sell their products or services in the LimaCharlie Marketplace using a revenue share model. We have had several successes using this model and are eager to develop the program further. Some products thus far are as follows.

### cuttingEdge 

>The Cutting Edge threat feeds are aggregated, filtered and augmented from a multitude of sources.
>
>Emphasis is put on timely Indicators of Compromise (IoC) for new and upcoming threats.
>
>Produced detections are made more powerful for operations by including a lot of metadata around the origin of the IoC as well as the nature of the threat which provides pre-emptive investigation data.
>
>A "sentiment" metric is also included to help you dial in the level of certainty you want to receive alerts for.

### soteria-rules

>A managed set of Detection & Response rules developed by [Soteria](https://soteria.io/).
>
>The rules cover most common attacks on Windows, MacOS and Linux. When subscribing to this service, LimaCharlie will automate the installation and updating of the rules in an opaque way. You simply get the Detections containing information about the detected behavior.

## Developer Grant Program

LimaCharlie is offering a $1000 in computation credits that can be applied towards using LimaCharlie to develop any kind of project you want. If you are looking to commercialize an idea we can help you get it into our marketplace and if there is traction there, we can further support you in growing.
