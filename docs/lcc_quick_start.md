# Quickstart Guide

LimaCharlie is a platform with vast capabilities which enable the user to build any kind of security pipeline or product they can think of. That said, the majority of LimaCharlie users make use of common and established patterns.

This guide is designed for users unfamiliar with the platform, to get them up and running with a solid foundation. Beyond that, it is up to the user if they want to grow their deployment in complexity or add niche capabilities.
