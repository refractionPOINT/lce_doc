# Multitenancy 

LimaCharlie is multi-tenant. It uses the concept of Organizations (tenants), Users, API Keys and Organization Groups.

## Organizations

This is an individual tenant (e.g. if youâ€™re an MSSP, this would be one of your customers). All data generated underneath an Organization is tied to the given Organization.

Billing is performed per Organization.

## Users

Users are operators or administrators. Permissions are applied directly to the User account and allow for fine-grained access control.

Users have a many-to-many mapping with Organizations.

## API Keys 

An API Key represents a set of permissions and are used to interact with LimaCharlie. 

Full documentation on API Keys can be here.

## Organization Groups

Organization Groups provides a way for managing permissions for multiple Users across multiple Organizations.

An Organization Group has a set of permissions associated with it that are applied to all Users in the group. Permissions are additive.

Organization Groups drastically reduce the administration required and allows for fine-grained access control.
