# Reference: Operators

Operators are used in the Detection part of a Detection & Response rule. Operators may also be accompanied by other available parameters, such as transforms, times, and others, referenced later in this page. 

> For more information on how to use operators, read [Detection & Response Rules](dr.md). 

## Operators

### and, or

The standard logical boolean operations to combine other logical operations. Takes a single `rules:` parameter that contains a list of other operators to "AND" or "OR" together.

Example:
```yaml
op: or
rules:
  - ...rule1...
  - ...rule2...
  - ...
```

### is

Tests for equality between the value of the `"value": <>` parameter and the value found in the event at the `"path": <>` parameter.

Supports the [file name](#file-name) and [sub domain](#sub-domain) transforms.

Example rule:
```yaml
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: is
path: event/PARENT/PROCESS_ID
value: 9999
```

### exists

Tests if any elements exist at the given path.

Example rule:
```yaml
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: exists
path: event/PARENT
```

### contains

The `contains` checks if a substring can be found in the value at the path.

An optional parameter `count: 3` can be specified to only match if the given
substring is found _at least_ 3 times in path.

Supports the [file name](#file-name) and [sub domain](#sub-domain) transforms.

Example rule:
```yaml
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: contains
path: event/COMMAND_LINE
value: reg
count: 2
```

### ends with, starts with

The `starts with` checks for a prefix match and `ends with` checks for a suffix match.

They both check if the value found at `path` matches the given `value`, based on the operator.

Supports the [file name](#file-name) and [sub domain](#sub-domain) transforms.

### is greater than, is lower than

Check to see if a value is greater or lower (numerically) than a value in the event.

They both use the `path` and `value` parameters. They also both support the `length of` parameter as a boolean (true or false). If set to true, instead of comparing
the value at the specified path, it compares the length of the value at that path.

### matches

The `matches` op compares the value at `path` with a regular expression supplied in the `re` parameter. Under the hood, this uses the Golang's `regexp` [package](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/), which also enables you to apply the regexp to log files.

Supports the [file name](#file-name) and [sub domain](#sub-domain) transforms.

Example:
```yaml
event: FILE_TYPE_ACCESSED
op: matches
path: event/FILE_PATH
re: .*\\system32\\.*\.scr
case sensitive: false
```

### string distance

The `string distance` op looks up the [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between two strings. In other words it generates the minimum number of character changes required for one string to become equal to another.

For example, the Levenshtein Distance between `google.com` and `googlr.com` (`r` instead of `e`) is 1.

This can be used to find variations of file names or domain names that could be used for phishing, for example.

Suppose your company is `onephoton.com`. Looking for the Levenshtein Distance between all `DOMAIN_NAME` in `DNS_REQUEST` events, compared to `onephoton.com` it could detect an attacker using `onephot0n.com` in a phishing email domain.

The operator takes a `path` parameter indicating which field to compare, a `max` parameter indicating the maximum Levenshtein Distance to match and a `value` parameter that is either a string or a list of strings that represent the value(s) to compare to. Note that although `string distance` supports the `value` to be a list, most other operators do not.

Supports the [file name](#file-name) and [sub domain](#sub-domain) transforms.

Example:
```yaml
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: string distance
path: event/DOMAIN_NAME
value:
  - onephoton.com
  - www.onephoton.com
max: 2
```
This would match `onephotom.com` and `0nephotom.com` but NOT `0neph0tom.com`.

Using the [file name](#file-name) transform to apply to a file name in a path:

```yaml
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: string distance
path: event/NEW_PROCESS
file name: true
value:
  - svchost.exe
  - csrss.exe
max: 2
```

This would match `svhost.exe` and `csrss32.exe` but NOT `csrsswin32.exe`.

### is 32 bit, is 64 bit, is arm

All of these operators take no additional arguments, they simply match if the relevant sensor characteristic is correct.

Example:
```yaml
op: is 64 bit
```

### is platform
Checks if the event under evaluation is from a sensor of the given platform.

Takes a `name` parameter for the platform name. The current platforms are:
* `windows`
* `linux`
* `macos`
* `ios`
* `android`
* `chrome`
* `vpn`
* `text`
* `json`
* `gcp`
* `aws`
* `carbon_black`
* `1password`
* `office365`
* `msdefender`

Example:
```yaml
op: is platform
name: 1password
```

### is tagged

Determines if the tag supplied in the `tag` parameter is already associated with the sensor that the event under evaluation is from.

### lookup

Looks up a value against a [lookup add-on](https://app.limacharlie.io/add-ons/category/lookup) (a.k.a. resource) such as a threat feed. 

```yaml
event: DNS_REQUEST
op: lookup
path: event/DOMAIN_NAME
resource: lcr://lookup/malwaredomains
case sensitive: false
```

This rule will get the `event/DOMAIN_NAME` of a `DNS_REQUEST` event and check if it's a member of the `lookup` named `malwaredomains`. If it is, then the rule is a match.  

The value is supplied via the `path` parameter and the lookup is defined in the `resource` parameter. Resources are of the form `lcr://RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_NAME`. In order to access a lookup, your organization must be subscribed to it.

Supports the [file name](#file-name) and [sub domain](#sub-domain) transforms.

> API-based lookups, like VirusTotal and IP Geolocation, work a little bit differently. For more information, see [Using API-Based Lookups](api-lookups.md).

> You can create your own lookups and optionally publish them in the add-on marketplace. To learn more, see [Creating Lookups](user_addons.md#lookups).

### scope

In some cases, you may want to limit the scope of the matching and the `path` you use to be within a specific part of the event. The `scope` operator allows you to do just that, reset the root of the `event/` in paths to be a sub-path of the event.

This comes in as very useful for example when you want to test multiple values of a connection in a `NETWORK_CONNECTIONS` event but always on a per-connection. If you  were to do a rule like:

```yaml
event: NETWORK_CONNECTIONS
op: and
rules:
  - op: starts with
    path: event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/?/SOURCE/IP_ADDRESS
    value: '10.'
  - op: is
    path: event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/?/DESTINATION/PORT
    value: 445
```

you would hit on events where _any_ connection has a source IP prefix of `10.` and _any_ connection has a destination port of `445`. Obviously this is not what we had in mind, we wanted to know if a _single_ connection has those two characteristics.

The solution is to use the `scope` operator. The `path` in the operator will become the new `event/` root path in all operators found under the `rule`. So the above would become

Example:
```yaml
event: NETWORK_CONNECTIONS
op: scope
path: event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/
rule:
  op: and
  rules:
    - op: starts with
      path: event/SOURCE/IP_ADDRESS
      value: '10.'
    - op: is
      path: event/DESTINATION/PORT
      value: 445
```

### cidr

The `cidr` checks if an IP address at the path is contained within a given
[CIDR network mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

Example rule:
```yaml
event: NETWORK_CONNECTIONS
op: cidr
path: event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/SOURCE/IP_ADDRESS
cidr: 10.16.1.0/24
```

### is private address

The `is private address` checks if an IP address at the path is a private address
as defined by [RFC 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).

Example rule:
```yaml
event: NETWORK_CONNECTIONS
op: is private address
path: event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/SOURCE/IP_ADDRESS
```

### is public address

The `is public address` checks if an IP address at the path is a public address
as defined by [RFC 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).

Example rule:
```yaml
event: NETWORK_CONNECTIONS
op: is public address
path: event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/SOURCE/IP_ADDRESS
```

## Transforms

Transforms are transformations applied to the value being evaluated in an event, prior to the evaluation.

### file name

Sample: `file name: true`

The `file name` transform takes a `path` and replaces it with the file name component of the `path`. This means that a `path` of `c:\windows\system32\wininet.dll` will become `wininet.dll`.

### sub domain

Sample: `sub domain: "-2:"`

The `sub domain` extracts specific components from a domain name. The value of `sub domain` is in [slice notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation). It looks like `startIndex:endIndex`, where the index is 0-based and indicates which parts of the domain to keep.

Some examples:

  * `0:2` means the first 2 components of the domain: `aa.bb` for `aa.bb.cc.dd`.
  * `-1` means the last component of the domain: `cc` for `aa.bb.cc`.
  * `1:` means all components starting at 1: `bb.cc` for `aa.bb.cc`.
  * `:` means to test the operator to every component individually.

## Times

All operators support an optional parameter named `times`. When specified, it must contain a list of [Time Descriptors](lc-net.md#time-descriptor) when the accompanying operator is valid. Your rule can mix-and-match multiple Time Descriptors as part of a single rule on per-operator basis.

Here's an example rule that matches a Chrome process starting between 11PM and 5AM, Monday through Friday, Pacific Time:

```yaml
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: ends with
path: event/FILE_PATH
value: chrome.exe
case sensitive: false
times:
  - day_of_week_start: 2     # 1 - 7
    day_of_week_end: 6       # 1 - 7
    time_of_day_start: 2200  # 0 - 2359
    time_of_day_end: 2359    # 0 - 2359
    tz: America/Los_Angeles  # time zone
  - day_of_week_start: 2
    day_of_week_end: 6
    time_of_day_start: 0
    time_of_day_end: 500
    tz: America/Los_Angeles
```

#### Time Zone
The `tz` should match a TZ database name from the [Time Zones Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
