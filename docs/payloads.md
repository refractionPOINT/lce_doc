# Payloads

## Overview
Payloads are executables or scripts that can be delivered and executed through LimaCharlie's sensor.

Those payloads can be any executable or script natively understood by the endpoint.
The main use case is to run something with specific
functionality not available in the main LimaCharlie functionality. For example: custom
executables provided by another vendor to cleanup a machine, forensic utilities or
firmware-related utilities.

We encourage you to look at LimaCharlie native functionality first as it has several
advantages:

* Usually has better performance.
* Data returned is always well structured JSON.
* Can be tasked automatically and [Detection & Response](dr.md) rules can be created from their data.
* Data returned is indexed and searchable.

It is possible to set the Payload's file extension on the endpoint by making the Payload name end with
that extension. For example, naming a Payload `extract_everything.bat`, the Payload will be sent
as a batch file (`.bat`) and executed as such.

## Lifecycle
Payloads are uploaded to the LimaCharlie platform and given a name. The task `run` can then be used
with the `--payload-name MY-PAYLOAD --arguments "-v EulaAccepted"` can be used to run the payload with
optional arguments.

The STDOUT and STDERR data will be returned in a related `RECEIPT` event, up to ~10 MB. If your payload
generates more data, we recommend to pipe the data to a file on disk and use the `log_get` command to
retrieve it.

The payload is retrieved by the sensor over HTTPS to the Ingestion API DNS endpoint. This DNS entry
is available from the Sensor Download section of the web app if you need to whitelist it.

## Upload / Download via REST
Creating and getting Payloads is done asynchronously. The relevant REST APIs will return specific
signed URLs instead of the actual Payload. In the case of a retrieving an existing payload, simply
doing an HTTP GET using the returned URL will download the payload content. When creating a Payload
the returned URL should be used in an HTTP PUT using the URL like:

```
curl -X PUT "THE-SIGNED-URL-HERE" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --upload-file your-file.exe
```

Note that the signed URLs are only valid for a few minutes.

## Permissions
Payloads are managed with two permissions:

* `payload.ctrl` allows you to create and delete payloads.
* `payload.use` allows you to run a given payload.
