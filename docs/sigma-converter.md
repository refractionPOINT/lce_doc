# Sigma Converter

## Sigma Support

LimaCharlie is happy to contribute to the [Sigma Project](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) by maintaining the LimaCharlie Backend for Sigma, enabling most Sigma rules to be converted to the [Detection & Response rule](./dr.md) format.

A LimaCharlie [Service](https://app.limacharlie.io/add-ons/detail/sigma) is available to apply [many of those converted rules](https://github.com/refractionPOINT/sigma-limacharlie/tree/rules) with a single click to an Organization.

For cases where you either have your own Sigma rules, or you would like to convert/apply specific rules yourself, the Sigma Converter service described below can help streamline the process.

## Converter Service

The Converter service converts one or many Sigma rules into the LimaCharlie D&R rule format. It can accomplish this via the following HTTPS endpoints availalble at https://sigma.limacharlie.io/:

### Single Rule

Endpoint: `https://sigma.limacharlie.io/convert/rule`
Verb: `POST`
Form Parameters:
  * `rule`: the content of a literal Sigma rule to be converted.
  * `target`: optional [target](./detection-on-alternate-targets.md) within LimaCharlie, one of `edr` (default) or `artifact`.
Output Example:
```json
{
    "rule": "detect:\n  events:\n  - NEW_PROCESS\n  - EXISTING_PROCESS\n  op: and\n  rules:\n  - op: is windows\n  - op: or\n    rules:\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: domainlist\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: trustdmp\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: dcmodes\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: adinfo\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: ' dclist '\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: computer_pwdnotreqd\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: objectcategory=\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: -subnets -f\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: name=\"Domain Admins\"\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: '-sc u:'\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: domainncs\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: dompol\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: ' oudmp '\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: subnetdmp\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: gpodmp\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: fspdmp\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: users_noexpire\n    - case sensitive: false\n      op: contains\n      path: event/COMMAND_LINE\n      value: computers_active\nrespond:\n- action: report\n  metadata:\n    author: Janantha Marasinghe (https://github.com/blueteam0ps)\n    description: AdFind continues to be seen across majority of breaches.

CURL Example:
```
curl -X POST  https://sigma.limacharlie.io/convert/rule -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data-urlencode "rule@my-rule-file.yaml"
```

### Multiple Rules

Endpoint: `https://sigma.limacharlie.io/convert/repo`
Verb: `POST`
Form Parameters:
  * `repo`: the source where to access the rules to convert, one of:
    * An HTTPS link to a direct resource like: `https://corp.com/my-rules.yaml`
    * A GitHub link to a file or repo like:
      * `https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_ad_find_discovery.yml`
      * `https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation`
    * An [Authenticated Resource Locator](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/ZG9jOjE5MzEwOTU-authenticated-resource-locator)
  * `target`: optional [target](./detection-on-alternate-targets.md) within LimaCharlie, one of `edr` (default) or `artifact`.
