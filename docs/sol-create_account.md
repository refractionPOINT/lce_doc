# Creating an Account

To gain access to LimaCharlie you will first need to create an account. This account can be attached to a specific email address (which will require verification), or through a Google, Github or Microsoft account.

Head over to [app.limacharlie.io/signup](https://app.limacharlie.io/orgs) and follow the login instructions. If an email verification is required you will be prompted to do so.

## Create an Organization

The first step is the creation of an Organization. LimaCharlie is multi-tenant and the tenants are structured as Organizations. Sensors belong to Organizations and billing is performed per Organization. The first time you login you will be presented with the [Terms of Service](https://www.limacharlie.io/terms). Read through and click accept.

You will be presented with a welcome screen. At the bottom of this screen click "*Create Organization*". This opens a dialog box with options to name the Organization and choose the location of the datacenter.

## Select a Datacenter

This is where your data will reside. Data does not transit outside of the geographical area in which the data center is located. Once a datacenter has been selected, this determines where in the world your sensors will connect.

The LimaCharlie global infrastructure is built on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Currently, computing resources are available in the USA, Canada, Europe, India, and the United Kingdom. Choosing a geographic location ensures data will always be processed in this location and never moved outside. New data centres can be spun up anywhere GCP is available upon request.

## Give your Organization a Name

Next, enter an organization name. This name must be unique. The "Name Available" indicator will show a green checkmark if a valid name has been entered.

LimaCharlie comes with a free tier of two sensors. You do not need a credit card to access this tier, but if you decide to upgrade your quota, your credit card information will be required.

Click "*Create*". Within a few seconds you will receive notification that your organization is ready.
