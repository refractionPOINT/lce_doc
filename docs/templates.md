# Templates

Templates enable manual and programmatic duplication of configuration between Organizations, or application of partial configurations to benefit from community solutions.

Powered by [`infrastructure-service`](infrastructure-service.md), Templates are a YAML representation of an organization's configured features. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Add-ons
* Detection & Response Rules
* Event / Artifact Collection Rules
* File / Integrity Monitoring Rules
* Outputs
* Net Policies

## Applying Templates

For granular control of organizations' templates, we recommend reading the [`infrastructure-service`](infrastructure-service.md)'s documentation.
