# Top Use Cases

LimaCharlie's vast array of capabilities can be applied countless different scenarios. The following are some of the more common solution stacks we see our customers using the platform for.

## Digital Forensics Incident Response (DFIR)

LimaCharlie is an ideal tool for incident response teams. LimaCharlie's endpoint agent can be deployed on virtually all operating systems (even the really old versions), allowing you to get set up in any environment in minutes.

We hate those “contact us for pricing” pages too. We charge $2.50 / endpoint / month. With month-to-month pricing, you can scale up / down as needed without needing to carefully plan in advance. There are no minimums nor long-term contracts to sign.

LimaCharlie now also offers a pure usage-based billing model that allows the deployment of our highly capable EDR for as little as $0.02 per agent per month. More details on this innovative billing model can be found [here](https://www.limacharlie.io/blog/2021/6/29/an-industry-first).

Fast, self-serve onboarding, with support when you need it

## Container Security

The days of racking and stacking are over. Cloud is the new frontier and it is often left without the protection enjoyed by physical devices. LimaCharlie's mass deployment functionality and automated sensors cull are among many features cooked in for life in the cloud.

LimaCharlie can now monitor Docker deployments (like Kubernetes) at the host level. This allows you to deploy LimaCharlie as a Docker container and gain visibility on all the containers within a cluster or host. LimaCharlie also supports Linux kernel network namespaces to associate complex network connection topologies to processes running in containers.

LimaCharlie lives in multiple independent data centers around the globe. Choosing a geographical location ensures data will always be processed in this location and never moved outside. Data is secured starting at the endpoint all the way to your infrastructure.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

The LimaCharlie agent can be deployed across all major operating systems for x86, ARM and MIPS architectures.

The agent is approximately 500kb in size and consumes less than 1% CPU on average. LimaCharlie is able to pack so much power into such a small program because it treats the agent as an extension of the cloud by utilizing a true real-time persistent TLS connection.

Exfil control ensures that you can tailor the amount of telemetry produced and focus on protecting what you care about.

## Continuous Integration 

LimaCharlie’s engineering approach to cybersecurity makes automated testing and deployment easy. Put an end to false negatives and gain peace of mind with a reliable test and deploy toolkit. Track changes in your detection methodology over long periods of time and run detections against historical telemetry.

LimaCharlie offers easy to read and well-structured documentation. Wether you are looking to dive headfirst into our quick start guide or want to plan a detailed migration we have got you covered.

Empower every level of your organization to contribute. Introduce a peer review process to your detection methodology that make cross-training a part of regular day-to-day operations.

## Chrome Shops

Whether native on a Chromebook or as a side-car agent in the browser, the LimaCharlie Chrome sensor gives you visibility and capability you can't find anywhere else.

The Google Chromebook holds the promise of a Zero Trust world but Beyond Corp still has one foot in academia. Until we have solved all of the hard problems the watchers need to keep watching.

Among its many features and capabilities, LimaCharlie offers an Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) agent for Google Chrome. The agent is loaded as a Chrome Extension and runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS.

The agent running in Chrome:

* Generates telemetry data on DNS and HTTP requests
* Provides visibility into extensions present in the browser
* Can isolate Chrome from the network, while leaving the LimaCharlie connection intact

The Chrome agent can run independently in the browser or in parallel with an agent on the operating system allowing you to receive more insight and capabilities. The Chrome extension provides insight without the need to perform SSL inspection and its related costs or TLS 1.3 difficulties.

## Managed Security Service Providers

LimaCharlie's predictable billing model makes it the perfect tool for MSSPs. We understand that margins are razor thin and that is why we offer the lowest price performance ratio industry wide. With no contracts or obligations you can bid on anything and have confidence that the deployment will fit with the price you quoted.

LimaCharlie offers in-depth, well-structured documentation, an e-learning platform and a vibrant Slack community.

Your success is our success. Working with the team at LimaCharlie will be like nothing you have encountered. We are responsive to our customers’ needs and are agile in what we can deliver.
