# An Engineering Approach

The way LimaCharlie is structured allows for the various systems and capabilities to be used in a variety of ways to solve common problems in security engineering.

## Incident Response

LimaCharlie's on-demand model and mass provisioning capabilities make it perfect for incident response. Wether deploying to a large fleet of physical endpoints or in containers in the cloud, LimaCharlie's infrastructure as code approach makes getting deployed on a new engagment a breeze.

The cross-platform agent will run on all versions of Windows (back to XP SP2), All of versions of Linux and MacOS. Feature parity exists across all platforms with the exception of OS specific commands. 

Get endpoint visibility everywhere quickly with the ability to do PCAP capture and analysis from the network. 


## Container Security 

LimaCharlie can be deployed into container environments in the cloud like Docker and Kubernetes.

## Continuous Integration

Take a devops approach to cybersecurity by leveraging historical threat hunting capabilities. By treating [Detections as Code]()

## Secure Remote Work
