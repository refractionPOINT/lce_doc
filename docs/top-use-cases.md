# Top Use Cases

LimaCharlie's vast array of capabilities can be applied countless different scenarios. The following are some of the more common solution stacks we see our customers using the platform for.

## Digital Forensics Incident Response (DFIR)

LimaCharlie is an ideal tool for incident response teams. LimaCharlie's endpoint agent can be deployed on virtually all operating systems (even the really old versions), you can get set up in any environment in minutes.



We hate those “contact us for pricing” pages too. We charge $2.50 / endpoint / month. With month-to-month pricing, you can scale up / down as needed without needing to carefully plan in advance. There are no minimums nor long-term contracts to sign.

Fast, self-serve onboarding, with support when you need it

When you get the call about an incident you need to act fast.  With LimaCharlie you can get set up yourself in seconds.  Give it a try -- sign up online right now, without having to talk to a sales person.  We even give you two free agents to try out risk-free (no credit card required).

Stop Giving Your Customers Away

That free Incident Response tool everybody is using isn't free. Land and expand with LimaCharlie and turn your Incident Response deployments into long-term Managed Detection & Response customers.

Collaboration Built-In

Respond to detections as a team and have a single place for all incident-related telemetry. You get full visibility into the actions your team takes in mitigating threats.

From a single screen you can:

* Assign ownership of an incident to a team member
* Discuss indicators of compromise
* Issue commands directly to impacted endpoints

With clear communication and operational continuity, it's more than a paper trail - it's a digital war room.

## Container Security

Security Built for Scale

The days of racking and stacking are over. Cloud is the new frontier and it is often left without the protection enjoyed by physical devices. LimaCharlie's mass deployment functionality and automated sensors cull are among many features cooked in for life in the cloud.

Management Tools for Containers

LimaCharlie can now monitor Docker deployments (like Kubernetes) at the host level. This allows you to deploy LimaCharlie as a Docker container and gain visibility on all the containers within a cluster or host. LimaCharlie also supports Linux kernel network namespaces to associate complex network connection topologies to processes running in containers.

Global Infrastructure

LimaCharlie lives in multiple independent data centers around the globe. Choosing a geographical location ensures data will always be processed in this location and never moved outside. Data is secured starting at the endpoint all the way to your infrastructure.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

An Agent That Runs On Everything

The LimaCharlie agent can be deployed across all major operating systems for x86, ARM and MIPS architectures.

Heavyweight Capability in a Lightweight Package

The agent is approximately 500kb in size and consumes less that 1% CPU on average. LimaCharlie is able to pack so much power into such a small program because it treats the agent as an extension of the cloud by utilizing a true real-time persistent TLS connection.

Control the Amount of Data on the Network

Exfil control ensures that you can tailor the amount of telemetry produced and focus on protecting what you care about.

## Remote Work

Work From Anywhere on Any Device

In a post-covid world organizations are more vulnerable than ever. BYOD and public access points, such as a favorite coffee shop, increase the attack surface exponentially. LimaCharlie has the tools to secure everything everywhere.

Zero Trust Networking at the Click of a Button

LimaCharlie Net changes the way that secure remote access is delivered. It is much more than a virtual private network and can be established with the click of a button. It is a micro-segmentable network that can capture full or partial PCAP files entirely in the cloud. All without impacting users. These captured files can also be analyzed with the Zeek Network Monitoring Tool and have detection rules written against them. 

And this is just the beginning of what is possible. Learn more here.

## Chrome Shops

Capabilities You Won't Find Anywhere Else

Whether native on a Chromebook or as a side-car agent in the browser, the LimaCharlie Chrome sensor gives you visibility and capability you can't find anywhere else.

The Zero Trust Promise

The Google Chromebook holds the promise of a Zero Trust world but Beyond Corp still has one foot in academia. Until we have solved all of the hard problems the watchers need to keep watching.

LimaCharlie Agent for Google Chrome / Chrome OS

Among its many features and capabilities, LimaCharlie offers an Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) agent for Google Chrome. The agent is loaded as a Chrome Extension and runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS.

The agent running in Chrome:

* Generates telemetry data on DNS and HTTP requests
* Provides visibility into extensions present in the browser
* Can isolate Chrome from the network, while leaving the LimaCharlie connection intact

The Chrome agent can run independently in the browser or in parallel with an agent on the operating system allowing you to receive more insight and capabilities. The Chrome extension provides insight without the need to perform SSL inspection and its related costs or TLS 1.3 difficulties.
